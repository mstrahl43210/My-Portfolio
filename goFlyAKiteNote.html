	<h1>Marcus Strahl: Responsive Bootstrap</h1>
	<p>
		In this case, a professor provided me with visual mockups of a website.<br>
		I used Bootstrap to create an actual website based on the mockups.<br>
		The primary purpose of the website is visual, so most buttons do not<br>
		do anything.  This website is very sensitive to screen size,<br>
		so try changing the size of the browser window.
