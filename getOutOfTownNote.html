	<h1>Marcus Strahl: UI Design for a Client</h1>
	<p>
		The following site was created as part of a simulation of a<br>
		client-developer relationship, with my professor acting as the client.<br>
		I worked on a team of 3.  We received a verbal request for a website,<br>
		and we asked the client for further clarifications. We worked together to<br>
		imagine user personas and plan for corresponding scenarios,<br>
		and then we created wireframe blueprints to plan for<br>
		the complete website.  Our client (our professor) gave us<br>
		feedback on the blueprints, and then each student was tasked with<br>
		responding to the feedback and developing the website alone.<br>
		My version of the website is linked below.
