# My-Portfolio
All favicons are by me. All other images are not mine and are
public domain (with no attribution required) unless otherwise stated.
The Bootstrap site is based on a mockup provided to me by a professor -- I only did the CSS, and only for this version
of that site.  My only intention is to demonstrate my ability to use Bootstrap and CSS, and to reach a target visual.
